# ThorFlashCards
Flash card website and chrome extension to create flash cards directly from text on a webpage and view them later on the homepage


#This Week's goals:

03/22 
buy domain; set up webserver; familiarize with Django, Angular/jQuery/React, Bootstrap, AWS/Digital Ocean; Nginx; Chrome extension

03/29
set up website backend services (including API access, authentication, basic flashcard functionalities)
front end not necessarily pretty by this point (bare bones meaning iterate through one set of flashcards)
