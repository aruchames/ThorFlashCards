# ThorFlashCards
Flash card website and chrome extension to create flash cards directly from text on a webpage and view them later on the homepage

# Local setup instructions
Install virtualenv, python >= 2.7.1, and pip on your local machine. DO NOT pip install django. 

First setup your virtualenv. Virtualenv essentially creates a virtual environment for your python, isolating
this app from other apps that you may want to develop.
```
virtualenv env
```

Activate your virtualenv

```
source env/bin/activate
```

You should see your prompt change from

```
whatever/
```
to

```
(env)whatever/
``` 

Now run 

```
pip install
```

You are now ready to run django scripts!


#This Week's goals:

buy domain; set up webserver; familiarize with Django, Angular/jQuery/React, Bootstrap, AWS/Digital Ocean; Nginx; Chrome extension

03/29
set up website backend services (including API access, authentication, basic flashcard functionalities)
front end not necessarily pretty by this point (bare bones meaning iterate through one set of flashcards)
